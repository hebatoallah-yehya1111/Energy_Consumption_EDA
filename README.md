# **Carerha Project - Energy Consumption Analysis & Dashboard**

## **Overview**

The Carerha Project focuses on analyzing energy consumption trends across different regions and time periods. By leveraging data analytics and visualization tools, this project achieved a **96% success rate** in uncovering actionable insights and building an **interactive dashboard** for real-time exploration of energy usage.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Data Analytics**

-   Resolved missing timestamps and anomalies in the `DateTime` column to ensure data accuracy.
-   Integrated datasets such as the "Demand Table" for comprehensive energy consumption analysis.
-   Engineered custom features to analyze regional and time-based trends in energy usage.

### **2. Business Insights**

-   Identified peak energy consumption during the **evening** across all regions.
-   Highlighted off-peak energy usage during **nighttime**, revealing potential cost-saving opportunities.
-   Region C demonstrated the highest variability in energy consumption, suggesting areas for optimization.

### **3. Interactive Dashboard**

Built using **Dash and Plotly**, the dashboard allows users to dynamically explore energy data with:

-   **Region-based filtering** using dropdown menus.
-   **Time-based filters** to uncover temporal trends.
-   **Interactive visualizations** like scatter plots, bar charts, and more.

### **4. Technologies & Tools**

-   **Programming Language**: Python
-   **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Dash, Plotly
-   **Visualization**: Interactive and dynamic charts for real-time exploration.
